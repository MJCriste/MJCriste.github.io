Introduction to the Dev Bootcamp Culture

9-20-14

Based on your experience thus far, what's your take on the DBC experience?

This is a passionate and fast-paced learning environment that will bring a great deal of positive energy to the material. It appeals to individuals who are both creative and analytical, and it opens doors to potentially very stimulating careers in a cutting edge industry. 

The school, despite its notoriety and success, seems to maintain a grounded sense of humility. They request that the students give regular feedback in how they can continue to improve their curriculum.

How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?

I was impressed that they offer as much tutoring as is needed. I think I'll be able to fully engage in the material at hand, knowing that the support is there. Also, I love to collaborate. I can already tell that my peers are impressive individuals with varying backgrounds, and I can't wait to get to know them better.

Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?

I'm surprised at the difficulties I've encountered in what seemed at first to be comprehensive and introductory material. From here forward, I plan to dive in with more committed, set aside time so that the material is completed well ahead of the due date. 

Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

I'm very excited, but nervous at the same time.

Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.

It makes me a bit wary after having had the task of "pushing" to the Github site being more problematic than I had anticipated.
