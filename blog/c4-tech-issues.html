<h1>The Hole is Greater Than the Sum of its Parts</h1>
		
<h3>From business and economics to journalism and art, BIG DATA's power has yet to be harnessed.</h3>

<p>One of the large problems inhibiting this advancement, surprisingly, is the structure of the scientific community. By necessity, they are very competitive, because in order to sustain their careers they have to hold onto their proprietary rights to their findings and work towards achieving publications of their research and findings. This significantly inhibits the potential growth in this field.</p>

<p>Another impediment coming from the scientific community lies in their tendency to specialize individually in one very narrow topic, usually to differentiate from competing scientists. These specializations focus on the microlevel of science, not the macro, so the result is a terrible shortage in data scientists.</p>

<p>The tools with which to work are equally scarce. The tools that are in place for the 0.1% of the population working in this field of data science are not sophisticated enough to be optimally effective. There is an enormous room for growth.</p>

<p>A big challenge that's currently at hand is figuring out how to handle what's been nicknamed "Dirty Data." This would include hand-written doctor's notes, slang or personalized lingo, or obsolete, inaccurate, or missing information. Cleaning up the data, therefore, is an important first step in moving towards an effective use of Big Data.</p>

<p>Doctors are reoccuring culprits in the fight against dirty data. Most use their own shorthand, oftentimes illegible, and many don't fill out the forms completely. There's another new term, "data discipline," that's being communicated to doctors and emphasized as to its potentially global importance.</p>

<p>Software is direly needed for the medical field for the above-mentioned reasons, but it's also vitally needed in most every field that relies on information and data gathering, computing, and analyzing. It's needed for both virtually and literally, everything.</p>
