<strong><h2>Pairing:</h2></strong>

<h4>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</h4>

I really enjoy working with my classmates. I find that I learn much more thoroughly and effeciently when pairing. It really creates a momentum and a focus that working alone doesn't provide me. I do, however, feel that these behaviors are becoming more of my independent studying as the course progresses, due in part to the rewarding pairing sessions that I've had thus far.

<h4>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</h4>

I really enjoyed my pairing challenge this week, when we were trying to streamline a decryption device to be used so that we could understand North Korea's coded army communication.

<p>My partner was very focused and dedicated, and brought a lot to the challenge. We did get to the point, however, when we needed to take a break, but when we later conferred via email, the work we had done paid off.</p>

<h4>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</h4>

I had more of a struggle in refactoring the credit card validation challenge. I had worked on it independently earlier in the week, so when it came to the pairing I was surprised at my desire to refresh my clarity on the Luhn algorithm, on which the challenge was built.

<h4>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</h4>

Well, I'm definitely going to be more mindful of where I situate myself for the pairings. I'm living in a very active house with quite a few roommates, so I though it'd be better for me to be at Starbucks, but based on my feedback I'm finding that that hasn't been the best idea. From here on out I'm going to make sure that either the house is quiet and without disturbances, or I'll go to the library and simply use my iPhone hotspot.

<h4>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</h4>

The feedback was very constructive. Yes.

<h4>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to
do to improve next time you pair?</h4>

I am going to make more of a point to enter into the pairing with more preparation. I plan to look over the challenge more thoroughly ahead of time, and have some proposed pseudocode, and even the beginnings of an initial solution before the meeting. I think I'll also have questions ready for the pair to discuss. I didn't make this preparation approach all of the time up until now, but after having read the feedback, I think will help me immensely.

<h4>How was it to write feedback?</h4>

I really enjoy the Socrates app. It's a great way for us as a cohort to support, encourage, and push one another. I love how every piece of feedback is sent through a process of ratings before received by the student. It's a great way to ensure constructive and quality insight into how your peers are responding to you.

<h4>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</h4>

The most difficult? I'd say pinpointing what could be actionable. It's one thing to be specific, but it's even more nuanced when you're trying to point out or give suggestions for things that you know will take them to the next level.

<h4>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</h4>

This is one of my favorite aspects of the Phase 0 process. Because these first nine weeks are all spent working remotely, it's very impressive to see how this process really brings the cohort together. I feel that I've gotten to know many of my peers very well. I know their work styles, their backgrounds, etc. And as I said earlier, I find that I learn and work at a faster and more effecient pace when collaborating with either another student or an instructor. It's a great system.</div>
