<h3>When you think of the times in your life where you have been the
happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, what values come to mind?</h3>

<p>Accomplishment, Activism, Ambition, Close Relationships, Compassion, Confidence, Coolness Under Fire, Creativity, Economic Security, Enthusiasm, Excitement, Friendships, Health, Honesty, Influence, Inspiration, Introspection, Leadership, Meaningful Work, Money, Nature, Personal Development, Wisdom, Adventure, Autonomy, Competence, Effectiveness, Fairness, Growth, Integrity, Justice, Mentorship, Movement, Openness, Physical Challenge, Quality, Responsibility, Self-knowledge, Serenity, Stability, Truth, Achievement, Affection, Challenge, Community, Competition, Courage, Decisiveness, Efficiency, Excellence, Freedom, Independence, Insight, Intellectual Status, Knowledge, Loyalty, Merit, Music, Order, Persistence, Pleasure, Recognition, Self-reliance, Sophistication, Vibrancy, and Will-power</p>

<h3>Pick one value from above and write a couple of sentences about why the value you chose is important to you.</h3>

<p>One of the most brutal yet empowering phrases I have ever come across is The Serenity Prayer. "Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference." I tend to not give up on something until I've reached a breaking point. It's an interesting experience to come out the other end having concluded that the only option possible is to accept. It's bittersweet. On the one hand it's a relief to be freed from the burdon, but at the same time it's hard to sacrifice the hope. I think "serenity" is an ongoing process that, if handled rationally, becomes an incremental step towards personal development and wisdom.</p>

<h3>In general, I try to live up to these values:</h3>

<p>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- [4] ----- 5 Agree</p>

<h3>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</h3>

<p>Education.</p>

<h3>How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</h3>

<p>Thinking about my values makes me feel more alive. It brings them back to my consciousness and gives me energy.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting correlation being drawn here. Yes, I definitely think that if your values are in your conscious awareness, mediating stereotype threat will be much easier to handle.</p>

<h3>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</h3>

<p>Meditation, jogging, music, talking with DBC friends and roommates.</p>
