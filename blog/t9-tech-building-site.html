<h2>Write about this experience of working on your own personal website. What have you liked, what has been challenging?</h2>

<p>Building my very first website has been a challenge, to say the least. It's something I've wanted to do for a very long time but was intimidated by the barrier to entry I had perceived. It's a skill that I think is very important for most anyone, in order to represent themselves, ideas, or products and convey their information and/or message to an audience in a captivating and user-friendly format.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge I had was in the beginning. I had a failed repository in our first week. I'm not exactly sure what went wrong, but when I later replaced it was my now current repository, I had files that were communicating with each other, from one repository to the next, and other files that were not.</p>

<p>I think this happened because I was building the initial web pages during a pairing session, and we were moving at a very fast paced. During that process, I think pages were made and duplicated without careful attention to which repository they were in.</p>

<p>HTML and CSS are interdependant with one another. It's essential that the files are organized with care, otherwise the site won't display any of the layout design. Luckily, with the help of a tutor, I was able to clean everything up and now the documents are in synch with each other and the site is up and running.</p>

<p>At this point, due to my limited skills, the site is only in its infancy. Our curriculum just started in on JavaScript and jQuery, and I'm really excited to make the site more interactive and entertaining. I'd like for there to be animation, and more variety in the design. I'd also like to be able to utilize audio/visual elements.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to building this up along the way. More to come.</p>
