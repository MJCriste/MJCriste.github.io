Getting Up and Running with Git and Github

Describe Version Control:

In coding, the vast majority of projects are done in collaboration. On occasion, one of the Developers may run into some troubleshooting issues (aka bugs). With Version Control, these bugs are prevented from compromising the work done up to that point. It preservs the good work that's been done up to that point.

Explain how git tracks changes:

Along the way, a Developer will want to commit (or save) the work they've done up to that point. Each commit is automatically tagged with date and time, so if someone wants to return to that point in the project, they'll know how far back in time they're going.

Evaluate the benefits of using Github to store code

Github is similar to the cloud, or GoogleDocs, in that it facilitates an environment for collaboration. People can expand on work that's already been done by someone else, and propose changes if they think they've added significant improvements to the project.
