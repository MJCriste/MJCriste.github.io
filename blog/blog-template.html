<h4>Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?</h4>

This is a passionate and fast-paced learning environment that will bring a great deal of positive energy to the material. It appeals to individuals who are both creative and analytical, and it opens doors to potentially very stimulating careers in a cutting edge industry. 

<h4>What is your impression of DBC?</h4> 

The school, despite its notoriety and success, seems to maintain a grounded sense of humility. They request that the students give regular feedback in how they can continue to improve their curriculum.

<h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4> 

I was impressed that they offer as much tutoring as is needed. I think I'll be able to fully engage in the material at hand, knowing that the support is there. Also, I love to collaborate. I can already tell that my peers are impressive individuals with varying backgrounds, and I can't wait to get to know them better.

<h4>Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?</h4>

I'm surprised at the difficulties I've encountered in what seemed at first to be comprehensive and introductory material. From here forward, I plan to dive in with more committed, set aside time so that the material is completed well ahead of the due date. 

<h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>

I'm very excited, but nervous at the same time.

<h4>Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.</h4>

It makes me a bit wary after having had the task of "pushing" to the Github site being more problematic than I had anticipated.</p>
