<strong><h2>Blocs, Procs, and Lambdas</h2></strong>

<p>A Ruby block is just a bit of code that can be executed. Block syntax uses either do..end or curly braces ({}).</p>

<p>[1, 2, 3].each do |num|
  puts num
end
# ==> Prints 1, 2, 3 on separate lines</p>

<p>[1, 2, 3].each { |num| puts num }
# ==> Prints 1, 2, 3 on separate lines</p>

<p>The collect method takes a block and applies the expression in the block to every element in an array:</p>

<p>my_nums = [1, 2, 3]
my_nums.collect { |num| num ** 2 }
# ==> [1, 4, 9]</p>

<p>If you look at the value of my_nums, though, you'll see it hasn't changed:</p>

<p>my_nums
# ==> [1, 2, 3]</p>

<p>This is because .collect returns a copy of my_nums, but doesn't change or mutate the original my_nums array. If you want to do that, you can use .collect! with an exclamation point:</p>

<p>my_nums.collect! { |num| num ** 2 }
# ==> [1, 4, 9]
my_nums
# ==> [1, 4, 9]</p>

<p>The ! in Ruby means this method could do something dangerous or unexpected. In this case, it mutates the original array instead of creating a new one.</p>

<h4>Learning to Yield:</h4>
<p>Why do some methods accept a block and others don't? It's because methods that accept blocks have a way of transferring control from the calling method to the block and back again. This can be built into the methods defined by using the yield keyword.</p>

<h4>Keeping the Code DRY</h4>
<p>Most everything is an object in Ruby. Blocks, however, are not objects, and this is one of the very few exceptions to the "everything is an object" rule in Ruby.</p>

<p>Because of this, blocks can't be saved to variables and don't have all the powers and abilities of a real object. For that, you need procs.</p>

<p>You can think of a proc as a "saved" block: just like you can give a bit of code a name and turn it into a method, you can name a block and turn it into a proc. Procs are great for keeping your code DRY, which stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. With blocks, you have to write your code out each time you need it; with a proc, you write your code once and can use it many times.</p>

<h4>Proc Syntax</h4>
<p>Procs are easy to define. You just call Proc.new and pass in the block you want to save. Here's how to create a proc called cube that cubes a number (raises it to the third power):</p>

<p>cube = Proc.new { |x| x ** 3 }</p>

<p>You can then pass the proc to a method that would otherwise take a block, and you don't have to rewrite the block over and over.</p>

<p>[1, 2, 3].collect!(&cube)</p>
<p># ==> [1, 8, 27]</p>
<p>[4, 5, 6].map!(&cube)</p>
<p># ==> [64, 125, 216]</p>

<p>(The .collect! and .map! methods do the exact same thing.)</p>

<p>The & is used to convert the cube proc into a block (since .collect! and .map! normally take a block). This gets done any time you pass a proc to a method that expects a block.</p>

<h4>Why Procs?</h4>
<p>Why bother saving our blocks as procs? There are two main advantages:</p>

<p>Procs are full-fledged objects, so they have all the powers and abilities of objects. Blocks don't.</p>

<p>Unlike blocks, procs can be called over and over without rewriting them. This prevents you from having to retype the contents of your block every time you need to execute a particular bit of code.</p>

<p>Calling a proc with a method isn't too tricky. However, there's an even easier way.</p>

<p>Unlike blocks, we can call procs directly by using Ruby's .call method:</p>

<p>test = Proc.new { # does something }</p>
<p>test.call</p>
<p># does that something</p>

<h4>Symbols and Procs</h4>
<p>In addition to the methods used above you can also convert symbols to procs using &:</p>

<p>strings = ["1", "2", "3"]</p>
<p>nums = strings.map(&:to_i)</p>
<p># ==> [1, 2, 3]</p>

<p>By mapping &:to_i over every element of strings, you can turn each string into an integer.</p>

<h4>The Ruby Lambda</h4>
<p>Like procs, lambdas are objects. The similarities don't stop there: with the exception of a bit of syntax and a few behavioral quirks, lambdas are identical to procs:</p>

<p>lambda { puts "Hello!" }</p>

<p>Is just about the same as</p>

<p>Proc.new { puts "Hello!" }</p>

<h4>Lambda Syntax</h4>
Lambdas are defined using the following syntax:

<p>lambda { |param| block }</p>
<p>Lambdas are useful in the same situations in which you'd use a proc.</p> 

<h4>Lambdas vs. Procs</h4>
Procs and lambdas are very similar. There are only two main differences.

<p>First, a lambda checks the number of arguments passed to it, while a proc does not. This means that a lambda will throw an error if you pass it the wrong number of arguments, whereas a proc will ignore unexpected arguments and assign nil to any that are missing.</p>

<p>Second, when a lambda returns, it passes control back to the calling method; when a proc returns, it does so immediately, without going back to the calling method.</p>
