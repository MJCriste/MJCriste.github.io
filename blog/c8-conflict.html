<h4>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h4>

<p>The vast majority of the time the person I'm in conflict is myself, though I'm working to change this.</p>

<p>Additionally, my most "go-to" reaction to conflict is avoidance. I tend to avoid conflict almost at all costs. Needless to say, this hasn't worked. The mental health suffers and negative feelings accumulate over time.</p>

<p>A significant conflict in my recent past would be a former roommate who I live with for about a year-and-a-half. I went into the relationship with the expectation that she would be supportive and emotionally available for closeness and a sense of "home."</p>

<h4>What was the source of the conflict?</h4> 

<p>It was problematic from the start, because she was not focused on developing herself into an evolved adult. She was a terrible underachiever; very smart, pretty and talented, but with nothing to show for it.</p>

<p>I think part of the problem was that she bought into my desire to fight against my nature and be something that I wasn't. She acted, at times, almost like a drill sergeant, trying to get me to "butch up", "man up," etc. I expected that she'd do it in a loving way. We both went into the living arrangement thinking it'd be like the sitcom "Will and Grace." Boy, did we have a rude awakening.</p>

<p>I was very depressed, and I think I was bring her down, and she grew to resent me. Also, irratinally so, she just lost complete respect for me. As my nature was at the time, I internalized almost all of it.</p>

<h4>How did you handle that conflict?</h4> 

<p>I told her that she needed to move out.</p>

<p>She didn't respond well at all, but at that point I finally showed my true colors, which I think caught her by surprise. I had thought that in order to have harmony with our living arrangement that it'd be easier to sort of cater to her and take a backseat. (Now that I look back, I think that that passive role is just in my nature.) Anyhow, she had no respect for that stance at all, even though she was so aggressive that there almost wasn't any alternative.</p>

<h4>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h4>

<p>I just had to end the relationship, unfortunately. It got very toxic, and I lost my desire to remain in contact with her.</p>

<p>When I stood up for myself, I didn't get anything but anger and resistance. I was perfectly willing to compromise and work things out diplomatically.</p>

<p>There was, unfortunately, nothing that could be done.</p>

<h4>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h4>

<p>Well, compared to then, I really know myself now and have compassion and understanding for my nature. I no longer have the Civil War in my head beating me up everyday. She joined into that Civil War full throttle, and I think that really was the root of our conflict, because she could see that I was loosing, and felt burdoned from the constant duty to get me to be something that I couldn't.</p>

<h4>What did you learn from this experience?</h4>

<p>I particulary took notice of an Avoidance of Shame strategy that is often misinterpreted: calling attention to oneself in ways meant to distract others
by “showing off” or being exhibitionistic.</p>

<p>I have know many people like this in my life and quite often was fooled that the underlying character traits were quite the opposite of what was being exhibited.</p>

<p>I think being aware of this phenomenon will be very useful in being effective with people, and knowing that (despite whether or not they have magnetic charisma) what you at once may find captivating and maybe even heroic, could be a sign that the person isn't emotionally available, or as healthy in their self-esteem as they may initially seem.</p></p>
