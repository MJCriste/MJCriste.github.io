<h4>Social Identity Threat</h4>

<p>I have been impressed with the Dev Bootcamp experience over the last
six weeks, and this blog entry prompt adds even more enthusiasm. This topic
resonates with me on many levels and I think it's important in order to 
empower the students to perform closer to their capacity.</p>

<p>From age 16 to 35 I identified as being a member of the gay community.
This was a very strong and certain identification, after all I was a man, and I was attracted to men. I didn't realize until recently that, for me, this was an oxymoron. Because of this firm belief, however, I was always discouraged with myself and others for my ability to be perceived and treated as one of the men. In every situation I felt that I was being oppressed and that I was a failure.</p>

<p>It wasn't until recently that I came across a different concept, Gender Identity Disorder. All of a sudden the concepts of gender started to solidify in my mind. It was as profound as being a color blind person who was seeing the colors of red and green for the first time. The interplay between the genders: the friction, the warfare, the harmony. All of a sudden I began to understand the concepts of "man" and "woman" and realized that I was indeed a woman psychologically.</p>

<p>This shift has caused me to look more closely at other concepts, such as homophobia. I have been surprised at how comofortable and welcoming heterosexual men have been with me once I threw away the expectation that they were to treat me like one of the guys. They don't seem afraid at all. I was projecting my fear onto them. The real phobia that was at play was my own heterophobia.</p>

<p>I'm so glad that DBC understands the importance of working through these issues, because this work is very collaborative and conducted in a very social manner, so if we don't know who we are, or we don't like ourselves, or we believe that we're inferior because of whatever label we've bought into (right or wrong), we're terribly crippled psychologically and emotionally. We're not mentally healthy and our self-esteem isn't derived from rationality, so then how are we ever going to be able to perform at our capacity? A healthy mind is a productive mind.</p>
